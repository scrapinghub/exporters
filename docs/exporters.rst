Config file
-----------

You can define Ozzy behaviour with a configuration object. This object has the
following attributes:

- reader (mandatory): defines what reader module the export should use and its options.
- writer (mandatory): defines what writer module the export should use and its options.
- exporter_options: it contains general export options, including output format.
- filter_before: defines what filter module should be used before transforming and its options.
- filter_after: defines what filter module should be used after transforming and its options.
- transform: defines what transform module the export should use and its options.
- persistence: defines what persistence module the export should use and its options.
- stats_manager: defines what stats_manager module the export should use and its options.
- grouper: defines what grouper module the export should use and its options.

This is an example of the simplest config file that can be used.
